# engyschool
Django project  for english school.
This project is in development right now. I dedicated this project to make an English school web site for my friends, but knowledge of django won't give you a full stack knowledge and my front end is clumsy. Before adding major Django features I decided to learn JS and front-end a little bit, so while I build the core - web site will have some presentation.

#TODO:
- Student-Teacher account system
- Personal cabinet - links to youtube-classes videos
- Zoom, Facebook, Google link
- Celery mail delivery service for notifications
#Possible TODOs:
- Some JS fun stuff to show my skills
- Timed events and APIs - quotes, structured statistics

Approximate launch date - June 1st
